Lists.

 * Just insertion and removal are O(1), but searching where to remove or insert is a linear search from the head or the tail which is O(N).
 * They do not support random access.
 * Linked Lists are data structures compose by nodes and links(usually a pointer) from one node to another, these nodes contain data.
