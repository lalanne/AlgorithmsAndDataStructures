 * In a binary search tree, data is sorted.
 * Lookup, insertion and deletion is O(log(N)).
 * In this implementation you can find iterative implementation of search
and a recursive implementation of size. Iterative implementation vs recursive
implementations is a nice topic to discuss, elegance and clarity vs probably
performance.
